# view-of-the-world

Hello, let's get started!

1. Fork this repository.
1. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository you just forked.
    Example:
    ```
    #navigate to the directory
    cd Documents
    
    #clone the repository
    git clone https://github.com/<ENTER_USERNAME>/view-of-the-world.git
    ```
1. Navigate into the directory you just cloned. Typically, it would be view-of-the-world.
    ```
    cd view-of-the-world
    ```
1. Run `git remote -v` and you see `https://github.com/<ENTER_USERNAME>/view-of-the-world.git` listed under origin.
1. Add a remote upstream.
    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/shavidissa/view-of-the-world.git
    ```
 1. Again, run `git remote -v` and you see both the origin and upstream.
